# 🧪 Semiconductor Wafer Pass/Fail Prediction

A simple yet effective web application using **Streamlit** and **TensorFlow** to classify wafer images as either **Pass ✅** or **Fail ❌** based on image analysis. 
This tool helps in identifying defective semiconductor wafers via a visual interface powered by a deep learning model.
